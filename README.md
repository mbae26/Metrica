# METRICA: Simplifying ML Model Evaluation and Benchmarking

## Introduction

Welcome to **METRICA** - a platform designed to streamline the evaluation and benchmarking of machine learning (ML) models. In the world of ML research and application, assessing the performance of models is crucial, yet often a tedious and time-consuming task. METRICA is designed to alleviate this burden, automating
the arduous aspects of model evaluation so researchers and practitioners can focus on what matters most - advancing the field of machine learning.

## Motivation

The journey of ML model development is filled with challenges, of which model evaluation is notably laborious. Traditional methods require the manual creation of
functions for analysis and visualization, as well as the establishment of benchmarks for performance comparison. This process is not only repetitive but diverts
valuable time and resources away from more impactful aspects of ML research, such as developing innovating models and conducting advanced analyses.

METRICA addresses these challenges head-on. By streamlining the model evaluation process, our platform empowers users to concentrate on pushing the boundaries of
machine learning, leaving the mundane yet essential task of performance evaluation to us!

## Key Features
